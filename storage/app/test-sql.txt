Beautifully fresh, sweet and meaty scallops. These have, brilliantly, been collected by hand from the seabed, the friendliest way these oceanic treasures can be caught. One of our favourite ways to enjoy them is seared in a hot griddle pan or skillet in some butter (just a few minutes on each side, till they're golden), then partner them with some smoky, spicy chorizo or snappy asparagus (or any other green veg will work).

<p class="p1"><strong>Our Background</strong></p>
<p class="p2">The Farmers Own initiative was started back in 2013 with Farmers from the Manning Valley in NSW. The brand began with a trial of just eight local stores within the Manning Valley and 12 Sydney stores in NSW. It's success saw the brand expand into VIC, QLD, WA, SA and NT, all the while building direct relationships with Farmers from key provincial areas within these states (Margaret River WA. Otways Regions VIC, Sunshine Coast Hinterland QLD and Barossa Mid North Region SA). In a challenging time for Australian Dairy Farmers, Farmers Own has been a good news story. Check out our packaging to see what our Farmers have to say!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our Deal</strong></p>
<p class="p2">We have direct relationships with our Farmers and not via a processor or a Co-op to ensure they are getting a good deal every time. Our goal is to pay our Farmers a good price for their milk that allows them to continue to produce quality milk. We pick up milk from their farms and transport directly to be processed so we know exactly where the milk comes from that goes into Farmers' Own milk. Our Farmers are engaged in the branding and feel a sense of belonging to the brand because it is their milk that goes into each bottle. We work with our farmers on sustainable and good animal husbandry practices and our farmers and families are proudly active in promoting Farmers' Own branded milk in their communities.</p>

Hand Dived Scallops (6 pack)
hand-dived-scallops-6-pack
1
<p class="p1">Beautifully fresh, sweet and meaty scallops. These have, brilliantly, been collected by hand from the seabed, the friendliest way these oceanic treasures can be caught. One of our favourite ways to enjoy them is seared in a hot griddle pan or skillet in some butter (just a few minutes on each side, till they're golden), then partner them with some smoky, spicy chorizo or snappy asparagus (or any other green veg will work).</p>
<p class="p1">Our hand-dived scallop will have an MCS rating of 2-3. Currently caught off the Devon coast and landed in Brixham.</p>

Mackerel, Fillets (300g)
mackerel-fillets-300g
1
<p class="p1">This is beautifully flavourful succulent mackerel. Season them with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and gently sizzle them in a pan with some olive oil. You'll want to leave the skin on for that lovely crispness, and it will also hold the fillet together.</p>
<p class="p1">Our mackerel has an MCS rating of 2/3 from Cornish or Scottish waters. Mackerel is mainly caught by handline, but occasionally by drift net or purse seine.</p>

Godminster Vintage Cheddar, Organic (200g)
godminster-vintage-cheddar-organic-200g
1
<p class="p1">A rich, strong yet buttery cheese that is delicious on its own, eaten with oatcakes and chutney, or devoured in hunks with an organic apple from your box. It also makes a sinfully good Welsh rarebit on toast. Good Godminster fortune shined down when we came upon one of the best organic mature cheddars we've ever had the pleasure to taste. This one makes the roof of your mouth tingle once you&rsquo;ve liberated it from its handsome, burgundy wax casing. Godminster, that&rsquo;s good!</p>

Eggs, Organic Free Range (6 medium)
eggs-organic-free-range-6-medium

<p class="p1">Our organic eggs are from free range hens that roam around in the sun, peck at an organic diet and get the benefits of free range (just like us). This makes their eggs perfect fried, poached or deviled. These are Class A Medium, cracking in a fry up.<br /> <br /> Andrew&rsquo;s eggs are part of the Laid in Britain Quality Assurance team for smaller producers. They assure standards particularly relating to food safety and no eggs laid under the Laid in Britain scheme have ever in its 17 year history been found to have salmonella. So even although they might not have that little lion on them there&rsquo;s no need to fret, these eggs are of the highest quality.</p>

<p class="p1">To avoid weeping buckets when it comes to chopping time, follow these tips:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- Chill your onions in the fridge before slicing - the colder they are, the better&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- Use a sharp knife - blunt knives burst more of those tear-inducing onion cells&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- Slice under a trickle of water - it helps wash away the pongy vapours&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- Wear swimming goggles&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Store your onions in the fridge, avoiding dampness, or in a cool dark larder.</p>

Broccolini Bunch each

<p class="p1"><strong><em>What to look for</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Choose compact bud clusters with no yellow colouring or large open buds. Heads should be dark green or have a purple tinge (except for Romanesco, orange broccoli and broccoflower &ndash; they are a lighter, brighter green).</p>

<p class="p1">Refrigerate in plastic bags. Use promptly.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>How to prepare</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Trim stalks and divide heads into even sized portions. The stalks can be left attached to the florets. Alternatively, stalks can be removed, sliced finely and used in stir fries and soups; or julienned and used in coleslaw. Broccoli is usually eaten cooked &ndash; however, cook only until tender and still slightly crisp. Cook using methods such as steaming, microwaving and stir frying. To blanch, simply place portions in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, drain and cool under cold running water. Blanching improves taste, colour and texture.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Ways to eat</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Broccoli is one of the most versatile vegetables. It can be served raw or lightly blanched and used in salads, pasta dishes, omelettes, quiches, soups and as a side dish.</p>

Garlic Australian each
1
<p class="p1">Bulb made up of segments called cloves, covered by a papery shell. The most common varieties of garlic contain 10 cloves (or segments) with white skin. Other varieties have pink or purple skin and larger cloves. As a rule, the smaller the clove, the stronger the taste.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">It is a member of the allium family that also includes onions, chives, shallots, spring onions and leeks.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>What to look for</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Look for firm well-shaped cloves. Buy in small amounts and break off the cloves only when needed. Garlic dries out once detached. bulb of garlic has had its roots trimmed, one at a time. Garlic is never labelled since it sheds its skin if a label is applied to it.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Availability</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">All year.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Store</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Keep in a cool dry place away from the sunlight. Avoid placing in plastic bags, or storing in the refrigerator or everything in the refrigerator will end up tasting of garlic. Avoid storing next to ginger as ginger dehydrates garlic.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>How to prepare</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Separate cloves from bulbs, remove papery skin unless roasting when skin can be left on. Cut bulbs in half crosswise and brush with oil to roast. To remove skin, press the clove under the flat side of a knife and the skin will come off easily. Chop the garlic very finely or crush it with the side of a knife. Alternatively, use a garlic crusher.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Ways to eat</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Garlic can be eaten raw or cooked. Raw garlic produces a strong, pungent flavour while cooking gives a more mellow flavour. The longer garlic is cooked, the milder and sweeter the flavour. It's usually used in small amounts, 2-3 cloves to a dish. Garlic burns easily, so take care when frying or saut&eacute;ing. It can be used in vegetable dishes, meats, soups, dips, stir fries, braises and stews. Add whole unpeeled cloves into a roasting pan with meat or vegetables. Cut a whole head in half horizontally and roast in a little olive oil. When cooked, serve as it is, or squeeze the roasted flesh out and serve on crostini or fresh bread.</p>

<p class="p1">Made from the best and passed every customer test</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Since June 2015, we have set out to create a healthier food range so you and your family can buy delicious, healthier food at great prices. When you see our green tab on our packs, you know it has been designed by experts, made from the best ingredients and approved by customers just like you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Aussie producers</strong></p>
<p class="p1">like our growers provided quality ingredients like the Durum wheat in our spaghetti. Aussie farmers provided 100% Australian RSPCA Approved chicken.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our chefs</strong></p>
<p class="p1">picked the best ingredients for their recipes, finessing and improved them based on the reviews each dish received. Soup, salad or pizza &ndash; every recipe was nibbled and quibbled over until it passed with flying colours!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our team of nutritionists</strong></p>
<p class="p1">worked closely with our food developers and chefs to take on the challenge of removing artificial colours and flavours as well as reducing excess salt, sugar and saturated fat without compromising on flavour. The range is also rolling out the Health Star Rating system to help you make healthier choices.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Aussie food enthusiasts</strong></p>
<p class="p1">were professionally trained up to taste and critique every product that was being developed. In fact, for products to get the green light they had to pass a blind taste test! We&rsquo;ve also launched Bunch, an online community of customers who&rsquo;ve been invited to try our products and share their thoughts about them in a whole new way, giving us genuine feedback on how we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

Farmers' Own

<p><span style="color: #39464e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #eeeeee;">Farmers' Own' comes from a group of innovative Aussie dairy farmers that have come together with Woolworths to bring you this great tasting quality Milk.</span></p>
<h2 style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 28px; vertical-align: baseline; background: #eeeeee; font-family: 'Fresh Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #39464e; line-height: 1.07143;">Our Background</h2>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; background: #eeeeee; color: #39464e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The Farmers Own initiative was started back in 2013 with Farmers from the Manning Valley in NSW. The brand began with a trial of just eight local stores within the Manning Valley and 12 Sydney stores in NSW. It's success saw the brand expand into VIC, QLD, WA, SA and NT, all the while building direct relationships with Farmers from key provincial areas within these states (Margaret River WA. Otways Regions VIC, Sunshine Coast Hinterland QLD and Barossa Mid North Region SA). In a challenging time for Australian Dairy Farmers, Farmers Own has been a good news story. Check out our packaging to see what our Farmers have to say!</p>

Our goal is to pay our Farmers a good price for their milk that allows them to continue to produce quality milk. We pick up milk from their farms and transport directly to be processed so we know exactly where the milk comes from that goes into Farmers' Own milk. Our Farmers are engaged in the branding and feel a sense of belonging to the brand because it is their milk that goes into each bottle. We work with our farmers on sustainable and good animal husbandry practices and our farmers and families are proudly active in promoting Farmers' Own branded milk in their communities.</p>
